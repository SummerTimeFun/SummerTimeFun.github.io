      <p>This is some of my work as a brand designer for a company with a well-established brand identity and expanding into the Enterprise market. As part of this expansion, we were introducing a new product to complement their primary SasS offering. This company serves as a reliable last-mile delivery solution for thousands of businesses across a variety of industries, such as food and beverage, retail, e-commerce, furniture, and pharmacy. Below  are some examples of the brand design materials I created to launch this new product.</p>

        <p>To begin my work, I conducted an extensive audit aimed at defining and refining the identity of the company's brand. I created a comprehensive Figma file to ensure that all the essential assets were captured, which serves as a valuable reference point for all subsequent work. Working closely with the brand manager, I took the initiative to develop an official style guide. This guide was designed to provide the team with a clear and concise set of guidelines, ensuring that all branding efforts are consistent, professional, and aligned with the company's mission and values.</p>

        <p>After completing the discovery work, I was tasked with creating a logo for a new side service. The service aimed to pair organizations in a supply-and-demand kind of fashion, and the logo needed to represent a sense of connection and community between these companies.</p>
        <p>My first step was to sketch out several concepts. I started with a broad range of ideas and narrowed them down to one concept that I experimented with in AI using the SVG of our original logo. I created several iterations, tweaking each one until it had the desired vibe as requested by the stakeholders.</p>
        <p>I then designed three concepts to show the stakeholders. The first concept represented the connection between the delivery companies, the second represented the driving aspect of the side project, and the third was based on the suggestions of the stakeholders.</p>
        <p>The connection logo proved to be the most successful. It still showcased our original logo, but the dots added a sense of connection between the companies. The variation in size of the dots created a flow between the supply and demand partners.</p>

      <h4 class="sub-title orange">03 newsletter</h4><h6 class="whisper">creating more modern assests to announce new product launch</h6>
      <p>I had the opportunity to design assets for a newsletter that would announce the launch of a new program. My task was to ensure that the assets accurately reflected the essence of the program while also meeting the stakeholders' expectations. One of the key requirements from the stakeholders was to give the brand a more modern and enterprising feel. To achieve this, I incorporated a new flow and design, and many of the patterns I established became part of the Brand Library.</p>
        
      <p>Following the connecting pattern, I created a flow between the pages using a road-like line that is integral to the visual language. I implemented a connecting pattern using a road-like line to enhance the user experience and create a seamless transition between pages. This design element is crucial to the visual language and serves as a visual enhancement for the user's journey through the newsletter.</p>

      <p>At the start of a soft brand refresh project, my brand manager and I were focused on bringing the overall look and feel of the brand up to date. We aimed to create a modern and clean aesthetic to be reflected in all assets. The first step we took towards this goal was to evaluate the brand's current impression. To do so, I prepared a detailed spreadsheet of survey questions, which my manager and I reviewed asynchronously. We carefully selected the best ten questions for our internal survey.</p>
    <p>As an experienced UX researcher, I thoroughly enjoyed applying my research skills to this brand refresh project. I believe that a successful brand refresh should be informed by data-driven insights. By conducting an internal survey, we were able to gather valuable feedback from our team members to help guide us in the right direction. This survey was just the first step in a larger project, and I am looking forward to continuing to apply my skills to help create a strong brand identity.
