      <p>These are components of my work with a company that has a well-established brand identity and is expanding into the enterprise market. As part of this expansion, we were introducing a new product to complement their primary SaaS offering. This company provides a reliable last-mile delivery solution for thousands of businesses across various industries, such as food and beverage, retail, e-commerce, furniture, and pharmacy. Below are some examples of the brand design materials I created to launch this new product.</p>

        <p>To understand the brand, I conducted a thorough audit to define the company's brand identity. I created a comprehensive Figma file to capture all the essential assets, providing a valuable reference for all future work. In close collaboration with the brand manager, we proactively developed an official style guide. This guide gave multiple teams clear and concise guidelines, ensuring consistency, professionalism, and alignment with the company's mission and values in all branding efforts. The guide reduced the cognitive load for our UX and Marketing teams.</p>

        <p>After finishing the discovery work, I designed a logo for a new supplementary service. The service intended to connect organizations in a supply-and-demand model, and the logo had to convey a feeling of connection and community among these companies.</p>
        <p>I began by sketching out various concepts. I initially explored a wide range of ideas and eventually chose one concept to work with in AI using the original logo's SVG. I produced multiple versions, adjusting each one until it achieved the desired vibe specified by the stakeholders.</p>
        <p>I created three concepts to present to the stakeholders. The first focused on the connection between the delivery companies, the second highlighted the driving aspect of the side project, and the third was based on the stakeholders' suggestions.</p>
        <p>The connection-focused logo was the most successful. It retained the original logo while incorporating dots to signify the connection between companies. The variation in dot size created a visual flow between supply and demand partners. Dots are also often commonly used in wayfinding designs.</p>

      <p>I had the opportunity to design assets for a newsletter that would announce the launch of a new program. My task was to ensure that the assets accurately reflected the essence of the program while also meeting the stakeholders' expectations. One of the key requirements from the stakeholders was to give the brand a more modern and enterprising feel. To achieve this, I incorporated a new flow and design, and many of the patterns I established became part of the Brand Library.</p>
        
      <p>Following the connecting pattern, I created a flow between the pages using a road-like line that is integral to the visual language. I implemented a connecting pattern using a road-like line to enhance the user experience and create a seamless transition between pages. This design element is crucial to the visual language and serves as a visual enhancement for the user's journey through the newsletter.</p>

      <h4 class="sub-title orange">04 brand awareness research</h4><h6 class="whisper">conducting internal surveys and external research</h6>
        
     <p>At the start of a soft brand refresh project, my brand manager and I were focused on bringing the overall look and feel of the brand up to date. We aimed to create a modern and clean aesthetic to be reflected in all assets. The first step we took towards this goal was to evaluate the brand's current impression. To do so, I prepared a detailed spreadsheet of survey questions, which my manager and I reviewed asynchronously. We carefully selected the best ten questions for our internal survey.</p>
    <p>As an experienced UX researcher, I thoroughly enjoyed applying my research skills to this brand refresh project. Data-driven insights should inform a successful brand refresh. By conducting an internal survey, we gathered valuable feedback from our team members to help guide us in the right direction. This survey was just the first step in a larger project, and I am looking forward to continuing to apply my skills to help create a strong brand identity.</p>

      <h4 class="sub-title orange">conclusion</h4>
<p>Our work on the brand refresh and launching the new side project was effective. The stakeholders were extremely pleased with the outcome I delivered. However, the company fell victim to the economic downturn and had to lay off most of its employees. Unfortunately, my computer was bricked, and I lost all my work. The only recoverable assets were the ones shown in this case study. I would have loved to showcase the progress of my work, particularly the logo, but unfortunately, I don't have access to my work anymore.</p>
