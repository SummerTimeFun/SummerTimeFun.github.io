      <p>Here is a sneak peak at the final solution. Continue below to read my process.</p>

      <h3 class="main-title">process</h3>
      <p>The first step was to conduct research on the target user group, which was delivery drivers employed by the organizations that used the dashboard. The research involved studying delivery drivers' pain points, preferences, and requirements to design features that support their needs. I worked closely with the UX Researcher to initiate user research. Working with the PM, we synthesized findings from the user research, my audit and data pulled from Amplitude and ProductBoard to determine the priority levels of each feature.</p>

     <p>Determine what key pain points were contributing to the issue:</p>
        <p>First wave: guerilla user research, being on a tight timeline. I had casual conversations with people at my workplace, cafes and parties. I inquired about how confident they were in their plant care skills and what routines they currently used.</p>
        <p>Second wave: I conducted more formal user research by emailed surveys, user interviews, and scanning plant forums. I inquired further about what routines they currently used, how they determined their watering schedule and what were the emotional outcomes of losing a plant.</p>

    <section class="small-wrapper">
      <h4 class="sub-title orange">02 scope</h4><h6 class="whisper">Defining functional and content requirements</h6>
      <p>Comparative/Field analysis: every app analyzed had a scheduling/calendar function, but didnâ€™t offer any much-needed suggestions or prompts. The lacking feature would leave the user confused and second-guessing how to water their specific plant. There needed to be more intuitive features built-in for this app to serve its purpose of reducing cognitive load and alleviate stress.</p>
      <p>I tested two apps with the functional requirements I was looking for; Plant Identification and Watering Schedules. </p>
        <ul>
        <li>1) Waterbot:</li>
        <li>- scheduling feature was seamless</li>
        <li>- simplicity made it easy to use</li>
        <li>- usability was compromised due to this simplicity</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>2) Picture This:</li>
        <li>- utilizes camera phone to identify plants</li>
        <li>- plant identification feature very accurate</li>
        <li>- did not have any other features</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
      
    <section class="small-wrapper">
      <h4 class="sub-title orange">03 structure</h4><h6 class="whisper">Interaction Design and Information Architecture</h6>
        
     <p>I created User Flows for a few critical tasks to ascertain what steps the user must take before creating the architecture of the app.</p>
    <div class="example-img">
        <img src="../assets/Mobile/account_deletion_android.png" alt="Android screens for account deletion">
      </div>
      <p class="example-caption">2.1 Android Account Deletion screens</p>

      </div>
      <p class="example-caption">2.2 Android Account Deletion screens</p>
      <p>Designing a sitemap helped me organize information and discover which features would be an asset to create the journey intended for the user.</p>
      <p>Aligning with my persona and goals, I determined the features to be included needed to be:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>1) plant Identification either by photo upload or searching easy to search list</li>
      <li>2) watering and fertilizing suggestions based on species</li>
      <li>3) scheduling capabilities based off app suggestions with the capacity to override and enter dates manually</li>
      <li>4) connection to main calendars available</li>
      </ol>

    <section class="small-wrapper">
      <h4 class="sub-title orange">04 skeleton</h4><h6 class="whisper">Defining the visual form</h6>
      <p>Given the task-centric nature of the app, I deduced that many would-be holding their phone while watering their plants. I focused on the Thumb Zone for call-to-action buttons, task checkboxes, and more frequented menu items.</p>
        
      
    </section>
      
    
      <section class="small-wrapper">
      <h4 class="sub-title orange">05 surface</h4><h6 class="whisper">Defining the visual style</h6>
      <p>Watering houseplants is meant to be a meditative and enlightening feeling. I wanted the visual style of GroJo to reflect that, and still be fun and light. To accomplish this, I kept the colour scheme light and airy, and gave the UI elements plenty of space to breathe. The look is minimal so the plants can take center stage visually. To create some fun in the design, I used vectors from icons8 Ouch collection.</p>

      <section class="small-wrapper">
      <h4 class="sub-title orange">solution</h4>
      <p>The best take-away I got from this project is to simplify, then go back and simplify again. At the start of the project, I wanted to add a lot of features and functions. As the project went on, I realized it was just bogging down the experience. I stepped back and stripped out many of the extras.</p>
      <p>GroJo is also the first project that I designed all the screens for. This process was highly valuable. I assumed I could soar through making all the screens given that I have such a strong design background. It took me many interactions to get the screens to get a sense of cohesion and the minimal UI I was aiming for. Another valuable lesson was understanding just how many different states the app could be in at any time, and all those states needed to be designed for. All in all, I learned a lot about the full process of designing a full app and all of its features.
